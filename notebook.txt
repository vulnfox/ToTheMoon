    "The way notebooks are formatted encourages exploration, allowing users to iteratively update code and document the results. In use cases such as data exploration and communication, notebooks excel. Science (and computational work in general) has become quite sophisticated: models are built upon experiments that are conducted on large swaths of data, methods and results are abstracted away into symbols, and papers are full of technical jargon. A static document like a paper might not be sufficient to both effectively communicate a new discovery and allow someone else to discover it for themselves.\n",

    "The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computational environment that supports over 40 different programming languages, but was first released as a web-based interface for IPython in 2011. Fernando Perez, a professor in the statistics department here at UC Berkeley, created IPython as a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded Project Jupyter in 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though the Jupyter Notebook interface has been around only about a decade, the first notebook interface, Mathematica, was released over 30 years ago in 1988. Other notebook interfaces have been released since then, but none have gained as much traction as Jupyter Notebooks have. Starting in the early 2000s, open-source scientific tools were becoming more and more popular and with the widespread popularity of Jupyter, it's well on its way to becoming a standard for sharing research methodology and results.\n",

    "### Why (Jupyter) Notebooks?\n",
    "Notebooks are used for *literate programming*, a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in 1984, in which a programming language is accompanied with a documentation language, or a natural language. In other words, the computer program has an explanation in a natural language. This approach to programming effectively treats software as works of literature ([Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf), \"Literate Programming\").  It supports people to have a strong conceptual map of what is happening in the code and also to have clarity on the flow and logic of the code/program. which is helpful for both the writer and the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter leverages this idea and enables users to create and share documents that combine code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and rich media. Notebooks are multipurpose and can be used in any discipline. The notebook is like a laboratory notebook, but for computing. Researchers can write code to work with their data while supplementing their methods with explanations, analysis, or hypotheses. Notebooks are also used in education because they enable students  to engage with content presented in different forms, experience computation with no prior experience, and practice programming in a scaffolded way. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "In our class, we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks to introduce you to how data scientists work with data, to learn about issues of justice using real-world data sets, and to also learn how to reason about the human choices embedded in the practice of data science and their significance.\n",

    "\n",
    "A notebook is composed of rectangular sections called **cells**. There are 2 kinds of cells: markdown and code. A **markdown cell**, such as this one, contains text.

    "## Notebooks in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "With proprietary software like Mathematica, users are supposed to trust the results returned and are unable to check the code. In contrast, Jupyter fosters transparency and hence encourages reproducibility, which refers to the ability to reproduce the results of a scientific study. Not only is the code behind the software available for anyone to inspect or tinker with, but code in the notebooks can also be examined or re-run to reproduce the results. Theodore Gray, the co-founder of Wolfram Research who was also involved in creating the Mathematica interface, said about Jupyter, \"I think what they have is acceptance from the scientific community as a tool that is considered to be universal.\" In other words, Jupyter Notebooks support the computational work of researchers from different fields, from astronomy to psychology to literature, and therefore enable new ways for researchers in very different domains to share research tools, methods, and learn from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The versatility of the  Notebook also has important consequences for data science and the workflows that are involved when working with data in settings other than research, such as for education and community science projects. The process of working with data can be messy and nonlinear, which a Jupyter notebook can handle well because of its flexibility (though this messiness is often reflected in the resulting notebook!). The power of the notebook lies in its ability to include a variety of media with the computation as a means to maintain accountability, integrity, and transparency for both the author of the notebook and the audiences that you share your work with. In a  world in which algorithms and data analysis inform many aspects of life and where computation is getting more and more abstract, the ability to understand and reason about computational work is more important than ever."
